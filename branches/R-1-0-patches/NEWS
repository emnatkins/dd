		CHANGES IN R VERSION 1.0.1

BUG FIXES

    o	pgamma(Inf, 1, Inf) gives NaN instead of an infinite loop, PR#462.

    o	Inline xaxt and yaxt parameters were ignored.

    o	Setting the normal RNG was not always recorded in .Random.seed.

    o	\link[pkg]{foo} links were wrongly translated to HTML.

    o	Direct use of show.data() with no args was incorrect.

    o	print.coefmat does sensible things if options
	show.signif.stars and show.coef.Pvalues are not set correctly.

    o	x <- list(a=1, b=2) ; x["c"] <- 3 now (again) stretches the list
	rather than give a "subscript out of bounds" error.

    o	Models with response appearing on rhs could cause segfault.

    o	as.data.frame.matrix will now ensure the columns added have
	non-empty names.

    o	Some (strange?) model formulas could cause memory corruption
	(thanks to John Fox for digging this up).

    o	Matrix multiplication in cases such as 1:3 %*% t(1:2) is accepted.

    o	Options --nsize and --vsize to R CMD check gave warning
	messages and only one was accepted.

    o	The autoload()s during startup are "wrapped" such
	that conflicting objects don't break startup.

    o	cor.test(*, meth="spear") {pkg ctest} now works (again) for n <= 6

    o	scale = 0 in biplot.princomp() now works.

    o	The scores given by princomp(, cor = TRUE) and the rotated
	values given by prcomp(, scale = TRUE) are now computed from the
	scaled data.

    o	barplot now works okay when length(col) < length(legend.txt),
	thanks to Ben Bolker, PR#494.

    o	kernel("dirichlet", m=10, r=1) in package ts now works.

    o	save/restore of	 environments containing "..." object should
	work now.

    o	qhyper should work better for large N.

    o	as.matrix.data.frame no longer escapes quotes in character
	vectors.

    o	R would try to save the readline history at the end of
	non-interactive sessions, causing crashes on some systems.

    o	Subtle roundoff problems caused arrays to be allocated short in
	loess.c in some cases, leading to segfaults.

    o	Document that postscript(file="") sends the output directly to
	the default printer.

    o	ts.union(, dframe=T) had a long-standing typo, now works.

    o	save(,ascii=TRUE) had problem with octal escapes in strings
	when there was a digit following, should work now.

    o	matpoints() and matlines() now also have a "type =" argument
	with defaults "p" and "l", respectively; PR#506.

    o   Some Windows systems would crash when printing was attempted.
        We believe that this was caused by a malfunctioning HP printer
        driver. A workaround for the problem has been installed. Also
        a problem with cut-and-paste has been solved.

    o   The new Perl 5.6 broke our version-detection mechanism. A
        better one has been inserted.
