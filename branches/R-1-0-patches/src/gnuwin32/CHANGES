		Windows-specific changes to R
		=============================

See the file NEWS for changes that affect all versions of R.


rw1001
======

The installer, rwinst.exe, now checks for ZIP files as well as zip files,
as some browsers manage to map filenames to uppercase.

There are batch files Rd2txt.bat Rdconv.bat Rdindex.bat Sd2Rd.bat
which are the equivalent of the Unix `R CMD foo' utilities mentioned
in `Writing R Extensions'.  To use these you must have Perl installed
(see readme.packages in rwxxxxsp.zip) and R_HOME set as an environment
variable (using the form P:/R/rw1001).  There is also a shell script
Rd2dvi.sh which you can use if you have sh.exe (as used to compile
packages) and latex etc. The environment variable XDVI sets the
previewer, defaulting to xdvi.bat.

Under rare conditions (lots of very short input lines) the history buffer
could overrun and so cause crashes. This has been possible since rw0623,
but first caused reported problems in rw1000 and has now been fixed.

Certain HP printer drivers (e.g. the 6/6MP-Postscript driver) reset the
FPU and so were causing crashes.  This has been circumvented in this
version by restoring the settings before and after each page.

Building on a non-default drive should be more reliable, as Perl is
used to find the current drive.
