Macintosh porting of R
======================

In this directory you can find all the files needed
to compile a specific version of R for MacOS.
The original code for MacOS was written by Ross Ihaka and
Wing Kwong (Tiki) WAN. Most of the files have been
modified or simply updated to work with current versions of R
sources (from 1.1.1) and the
Waste Text Engine (c) 1993-2000 Marco Piovanelli.

Before building R
=================

There are only two files that must be uncompressed before
starting compiling R. These are 
src/macintosh/res/R.rsrc.hqx	-  the R application resource file
src/macintosh/cwpro/R.mcp.hqx	-  the CodeWarrior Project file
and you need to expand them via any hqx decoding utility.


Building R
==========

The R binary can be compiled using Code Warrior Pro 6, called CW
subsequently, by simply opening the file "R.mcp" in the "cwpro" directory.
To build the R application you need version 2.x of the Waste Library
by Marco Piovanelli. This should be included in the CW6 distribution.
In case you don't have this, please download the full archive at the
official Waste library site: http://www.merzwaren.com/waste

You also need a fortran compiler or an F2C tool to compile the
*.f fortran files in src/appl directory.
The R.mcp project assumes that you have converted the files with F2C 
and put the *.c sources in /src/appl/mac_f2c directory.


Once you have built the R application, copy the "R" binary 
from "src/macintosh/bin" in the folder  
where you put also the "library" directory (with all 
packages built), the "afm", "demos" and "tests"
directories. The distribution folder should appear as

afm/		(dir)
demo/		(dir)
library/	(dir)
R		(file)
tests/		(dir)

Before building R :
===================

1) Please rename the file "src/include/macintosh/config.mac.h" to 
   "src/include/config.h" and copy it over
   "src/include/macintosh/Rconfig.h" 
   before you build the R application.

2) if you do not use F2C you need a fortran compiler
   and also to change the R.mcp project.


Building packages
=================

To build packages, refer to the respective "src/<pkg>/src/macintosh/"
directory where you can find a CW project.  Once you have built a package
you should move the resulting file to the "libs" directory in the
"library/package" folder.

There is still no "makefile" to build the R application, configure it,
build help and doc files etc. You can take the help and examples files from
the Windows version by simply copying the whole directories in their
respective counterparts of the R distribution for MacOS.

Most of the files in the scr/macintosh directory are only partially
commented. This will change in the near future. The GUI sources are adapted
from the WasteDemo application from the Waste Text Engine distribution.
Thanks to Marco Piovanelli for providing these sources for free.

---------

Note that the process of building R for the Macintosh is
still not satisfactory to us, and bound to be improved.
This will hopefully change in v 1.3.x of R.
